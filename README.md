# Angular Tour of Heroes - Tutorial

This project is a thorough tutorial of AngularJS

## What I Learned

* I learned about Angular's two-way data binding, which is a mechanism by which the model is synced from the view and the controller
* I learned about components, how they are structured, and also how their layouts and styles can be separated into different files
* I learned about `Service`s in Angular, and how to inject them into different components
* I learned about dependency injection for Angular classes, and how useful DI can be for creating classes that are more easily tested and managed
* I learned about Angular routing and how you can control the user's navigation experience in your web app
* I learned how to add dependencies to an Angular project, noting that it required a restart of the web app (and my text-editor)
* I learned how to use Observables
* I learned how to use an in-memory Web API for retrieving data

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
